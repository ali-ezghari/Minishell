cmds: 

PASRSING:

=> echo ''$?''"42" : should prints only code followed 42 =>(042). but it prints (0  42). || FIXED
=> echo hi | "|" : causes syntax error but "|" should be treated as a string, so that it can be handled in the exection || FIXED
=> echo "exit_code ->$? user ->$USER home -> $HOME" : Doesn't expand nothing || FIXED
=> $/ : when you parse this command you remove the $. And i only receive /. the $ should remain. and i should receive the command like it was ($/) || FIXED


=> exit : double free

    => free_commands  → cleanup_shell → main

    => free_all → bin_exit → execute_builtin → ...

    reason: I use free_all function in builtin exit to free data and you free up the same thing in your free_commands function, i suppose that causes the double free
